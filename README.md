# FRACT'OL : *Computer Graphics Fractals*

> A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern remains the same at every scale.

This project is a basic computer graphics project coded in C, it uses the MiniLibX (42 school graphical library). It was an opportunity to implement the algorithm to vizualise graphically Fractals and thus to use the mathematical notion of **complex numbers**, to take a peek at the concept of **optimization** in computer graphics and practice **event handling**.

The program has to implement the **Julia** set and the **Mandelbrot** set, while the mouse infinitely zooms in the fractal and offers us a beautiful spectacle of endless fractals and colors.
